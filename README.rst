About deep-xf
=============

`DeepXF` is an open source, low-code python library for forecasting and nowcasting tasks. `DeepXF` helps in designing complex forecasting and nowcasting models with built-in utility for time series data. One can automatically build interpretable deep forecasting and nowcasting models at ease with this `simple`, `easy-to-use` and `low-code` solution. It enables users to perform end-to-end Proof-Of-Concept (POC) quickly and efficiently. One can build models based on deep neural network such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional RNN/LSTM/GRU (BiRNN/BiLSTM/BiGRU), Spiking Neural Network (SNN), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and others. It also provides facility to build nowcast model using Dynamic Factor Model.

`DeepXF` is conceived and developed by Ajay Arunachalam - https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-arunachalam-4744581a/

Please Note:- This is still by large a work in progress, so always open to your comments and things you feel to be included. Also, if you want to be a contributor, you are always most welcome. The RNN/LSTM/GRU/BiRNN/BiLSTM/BiGRU are already part of the initial version roll-out, while the latter ones (SNN, GNN, Transformers, GAN, CNN, etc.) are work in progress, and will be added soon once the testing is completed. 


The library provides (not limited too):-
========================================

- Exploratory Data Analysis with services like profiling, filtering outliers, univariate/multivariate plots, plotly interactive plots, rolling window plots, detecting peaks, etc. 

- Data Preprocessing for Time-series data with services like finding missing, imputing missing, date-time extraction, single timestamp generation, removing unwanted features, etc. 

- Descriptive statistics for the provided time-series data, Normality evaluation, etc.

- Feature engineering with services like generating time lags, date-time features, one-hot encoding, date-time cyclic features, etc.

- **Finding similarity between homogeneous time-series inputs with Siamese Neural Networks.**

- **Denoising time-series input signals.**

- **Building Deep Forecasting Model with hyperparameters tuning and leveraging available computational resource (CPU/GPU).**

- **Forecasting model performance evaluation with several key metrics** 

- **Game theory based method to interpret forecasting model results.**

- **Building Nowcasting model with Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm**

- **Explainable Nowcasting**
